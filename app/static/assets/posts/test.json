Paraphrased it states \u201cTo those who have, more will be given. From those who have not, even what they have will be taken away\u201d.</p>\n\n    <h3>How does this apply to you?</h3>\n\n    <p>I\u2019ve always had a long-held desire to be part of those people who have; those who have real-estate holdings in the millions, well diversified investments, trust funds and so forth. It\u2019s not the display of wealth or the signalling of status that appeals to me, but rather the allure comes from the security and opportunity wealth represents.</p>\n\n    <p>When you have wealth, it accumulates and after a certain point, your wealth will grow exponentially, but your expenditure stays constant (provided your lifestyle remains constant). Even if your expenses do increase, your utility increases less than linearly making it less attractive to excessively spend. Security is also important. To be wealthy enough such that unexpected events don\u2019t cause undue emotional pain is never a bad thing. To not have to worry about the costs of medical care, home and care repairs is a goal worth having.</p>\n\n    <h3>I\u2019ve always had a problem of measuring myself on effort or not trying 100%.</h3>\n\n    <p>This passage is inspirational for me because it implies that returns on hard work are non-linear. When you\u2019re part of the have-nots, each hour of work won\u2019t result in much but as part of the have\u2019s, each hour of work results in exponential returns. What this means to me is that partial effort results in minimal returns, but putting in 100% effort will result in outsized returns. If you want something, there\u2019s not point trying half-heartedly to achieve it - there are no partial marks to be awarded. Try with all your effort, with all the creative ideas your can muster and with all the efficiencies you can find</p>        \n    "
